Retail Promotion and Consumer Behavior Simulation

## Overview
Simulates consumer behavior, pricing, and inventory management to optimize retail strategies. Built using AgentTorch, this model provides insights into consumer-product interactions for enhancing sales and stock efficiency.

## Intended Use
- **Users**: Retail analysts, strategists.
- **Applications**: Analyze promotions, pricing strategies, and inventory management.

## Inputs
- **Agent State**: Budget, preferences, price sensitivity.
- **Environment State**: Product prices, stock levels, promotions.

## Model Architecture
An agent-based model where consumers interact with a dynamic retail environment. Core components include:
- **Agents**: Represent consumers.
- **Environment**: Simulates retail space.
- **Policy**: Guides decisions based on utility functions.
- **Transition**: Updates state post-purchase.
- **Aggregator**: Collects data for analysis.

## Substeps
1. **Perception**: Agents observe prices, promotions, stock.
2. **Decision**: Utility functions determine purchases.
3. **Action**: Agents buy products, impacting stock.
4. **Environment Update**: Adjusts stock, triggers reorders.
5. **Aggregation**: Gathers data for metrics.

## Outputs
- **Sales Data**: Products sold, volume, velocity.
- **Stock Levels**: Trends over time.
- **Metrics**: Consumer behavior and promotion impact.

## Performance
- **Metrics**: Sales volume, stock depletion, promotion effectiveness.
- **Evaluation**: Benchmarked with test scenarios and historical data.

## Limitations
- Assumes static preferences and simplified behavior.
- Reordering rules may not capture real-world complexities.

## Ethical Considerations
- Ensure unbiased modeling and transparency of assumptions.
